-	They can get updates and emails on the subscribed events.

**After subscribing to the event,**
-	The user should be able to see a list of events happening and subscribed by him to return to the starting location (show on a map?)
The website is cooperative, not complex to find the company and subscribe to the events happening.

## Technology stack descriptions :

### Backend framework 
- The backend Framework we are using is adonisJs which is writtern in JavaSprint
- It is a fully optimized frame work which advanced methods and feature for relation struture data operation.

### Backend free app host 
- The Backend app host for our project would be *HEROKU*
### Data host 
- The data host we are planning to use is freesqldatabase which provides as three free database
### Front-end plan 
- For the frontend  we planning to use vue js framework which is an component based framework
### Front-end responsive design 
- The Front-end responsive design would be *Bootstrap*



## Risks and assumptions :


-	The user should be able to login into page using email id and password
-	Displaying the different dashboards for each of the accounts Admin, User, and Committe User.
-	Making sure the system is compatible with all web browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome,Internet Explorer, Safari, Edge, etc.)
-	MySQL database that holds all info on organizations, organization's events and user informaqtion.
-	Admin should be able to view a list of all organizations, organization's events and the user who registered for the particular events.
